Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Its simply the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applicatiions. its importance include ensuring high quality software, improving productivity, enhancing security and driving technology

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1968; Birth of Software Engineering- In 1968, NATO held a conference in Germany where the tern software enginnerimg was first mentioned.
1980s; The rise of Object Oriented programming- OOP introduced encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism
2001; The Agile revolution; agile promotes, flexibility, scalability and collaboration

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The life cycle has 6 key phases:
1. Planning- defines project goals, scope, budget and timeline
2. Requirement Analysis- gathers and document functions and non functional requirements
3. Design- creates system architecture, UI/UX design and database structure
4. Implementation- develpers write code based on the design specification
5. Testing- heklps in idendifying and fixing of bugs
6. Deployment and maintainance- software is released to users 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall follows a linear and sequentialprocess where each phase  such as planning , designing , coding, testing and deployment must be completed before moving to the next. Waterfall is ideal for projects like banking software. Meanwhile, agile methodologies focusses on continous development and customer feedback. Here, work is done in short cycles called sprenits, allpowing for frequent updates and modification. examples include mobile app and web development



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer- is mainly responsible for designing, coding and implementation of spoftware solutions
2. Quality Assuarance Engineere- ensures that the software is buig free , reliable and meets the quality standards
3. Project Manager=- oversees  the entire software development process ensuring that it it stays on schedule, within the budget and meets the objectives


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs helps in 
-Multi language support
-project management especially when a project is large
-Integratted debbugging- it does so withe the help of the in built debiggers
-Helps for code efficiency and speed due to features such as auto- completion, syntax highlighting and debigging tools 

Examples of IDEs include- Visual studio code, pycharm

Versuion control systems hekps developers track changes in code. They include; Git, Mercurial and Subversion

VCS help in 
-Collaboration
-Branching and merging
- Error recovery
- Code review and quality control


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Debugging and fixing bugs-we can use debugging tools in IDEs
2. Keeping up with rapid technological changes- continuosly learn the emerging trends
3. Managing project deadlines- use automated testing
   
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit testing- this involves testing individual components or functions of the software . Its important in idendifying bugs early and ensuring code correctness
2. Integration testing- this ensures that different moduleswork together correctly. It is important in detecting communication issues
3. System testing- this one tests the complete software asa whole. It is important in ensuring that the entire applicationmeets business anmd technicalrequirements
4.  Acceptance Testing-  It is conducted by the end users  to verify if the software meets the needs. It is important in checking iof the software is ready is deployment


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing and refining imputs to effectively interact with ai models  in order to get the most accurate , relevant and useful answers 

Importance
-Improves efficiency by reducing the need for multiple iterations by getting the right responses
-Enhances accuracy and relevance through well crafted prompts
-Facilitates better decision making anmd optimizes AI capailities


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example; Tell me about technology
Improved Prompt; Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on cybersecurity giving advantages and disadvantages

Why the improved version is more effective
-It is more concise and structured and clear to the point
